title: Core Concepts and Features
description: Understand the foundational elements of Pepperstars, including its architecture, key features, and how they integrate to support software development workflows.
---

## Overview

Pepperstars provides a modular platform that streamlines software development workflows. You build, test, and deploy applications using its core components: a microservices architecture, integrated CI/CD pipelines, and extensible APIs. These elements work together to accelerate your development cycles while maintaining scalability and security.

## Platform Architecture

Pepperstars uses a layered microservices architecture for flexibility and resilience. Client applications connect to the API gateway, which routes requests to services like authentication, data processing, and deployment engines.

    A[Client Apps] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Auth Service]
    B --> D[Build Service]
    B --> E[Deploy Service]
    D --> F[Database]
    E --> G[Cloud Hosts]
```

This design ensures high availability. Each service scales independently, and you monitor performance through built-in dashboards.
